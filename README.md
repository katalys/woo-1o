1o to WooCommerce Merchant Plugin

Main plugin files for requests and responses are located in:
 1. **Core Plugin File**: katalys-shop/assets/inc/functions.php
 2. **GRAPHQL Requests**: katalys-shop/assets/inc/graphql-requests.php
 3. **Plugin Setup**: katalys-shop/1o-merchant-plugin.php

There should be no need to edit any other files (especially the vendor files) as these are code library files with no settings needed.
